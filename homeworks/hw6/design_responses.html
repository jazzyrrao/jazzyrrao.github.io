					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the animation in the user interface should mimic the actual movements we are familiar with, such as friction, acceleration, etc. Device sizes have an impact on animations as well. Therefore, it is important to take into account the animations' speed and sequence. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed reading about all the different easing curves. The animations really allowed me to recognized the differences. It also helped me better understand how and when to use them.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "The movement of the objects should be clear and sharp so do not use motion blur (yes, After Effects users, not this time)." </p>
						</li>
