					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> White space, padding, is your best friend when it comes to creating visual consistency, clarifying relationships, and enhancing readability on an interface. White space is not wasted space. Correctly utilizing white space can help reduce visual noises and improve overall user experience.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is where the author talks about the common concerns when using white spaces. He described how many stakeholders are worried that if they don't fit everything on one screen, users won't be able to see all of their content. In reality, having a screen full of content would only make users feel overwhelmed and decrease their interest. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> “Can you add 8 pixels of padding here and also there? … Actually, let’s make it 16 pixels.” </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
