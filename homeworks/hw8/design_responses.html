					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned that dark pattern is a deceptive user experience that preys on the ways in which people habitually use websites and apps to influence users to take actions they did not intend to. There are  12 different types of dark patternst. They are often utilized when a business is overly concerned with growth and profits. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I found it interesting to read about the various kinds of dark patterns and how common they are on websites. Companies who choose dark patterns may appear to profit from it, but such benefits are just temporary. In the end, it destroys user loyalty and results in brand patronage decline. </p>
