                            <p> All of the designs that are shown are visually oriented with a lot of animated interactions. It seem like "cool" animation has been the popular way designers use to attarct users. However, I did find some of them a little distracting and overwhelming. </p>

                            <p> I enjoy scorlling through the different designs that people created for different purposes. It is very interesting to see the different approaches the designers took to convey their intentions. It really reflects how ones aesthetic preferences impact the delivery of a design. </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite inspirations were easygrow.io app preview by Edmond Vasar and Shazam style shopping UI by Cuberto. Both, in my opinion, do a great job of showing people what their designs' ultimate purpose is. In the Shazam design the clothing identifier was the first feature displayed, and a waterfall sequence was used to show the clothing it recognized as well as other styles that were similar to the original, which allowed users to have more options and freedom. Additionally, the display of pricing and brief description of all the apparel item allow users to filter through the results and gain a better understanding of what they want and need.</p>

                            <p> 7. It's nice to see different designs of different purpose but it would be nicer if there was a brief description for each so I can have a better understanding of their design choices and learn from it.</p>
