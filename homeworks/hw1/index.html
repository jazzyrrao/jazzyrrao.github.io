            <p> I am a designer at UC Berkeley pursuing a bachelor’s in architecture, certificate in design, minors in city planning and sustainable design. I am interested in creating more accessible and intuitive designs while striving to incorporate a diverse worldview through better understanding human interactions and behaviors. ​​​​​​​</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Something I learned from this article was how to analyze a deisgn product by looking at both its aesthetic choices and intentions. From highlighted information or color/text treatment, we can identify the deisgn hierachy. From recognizing the end goal, we can better understand the audience and enhance the user experience. </li>
                        <li> My favorite part of the article was the observations she made through deconstructing the apps. It's fun to read the investigation of every little detail that I might have overlooked while using the app.</li>
                        <li>"It’s not just “Add a Tweet”, it’s “Add another Tweet”."</li>
