						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that you must first identify the purpose of your design and your audience in order to select a typeface that will enhance your design. Looking through works of other designers can help better understand the relationship you are trying to establish with your font and design. Additionally, selecting the right font combinations is important. Good Integration ofÂ different fonts gives your designs a visual hierarchy and improves readability.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article was how to determine font sizes. I only have one way to determine my font sizes, which is using my eyes. So it's very interesting to see the variety of ratios based on geomety, nature, and music applying to font sizes.  </p>
